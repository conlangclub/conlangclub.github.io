    <h3>IPA matrix poster (2022)</h3>
    <figure>
      <a href="assets/images/propaganda/matrix.png"><img class="border" src="assets/images/propaganda/matrix.png" alt="A poster with a square matrix of IPA letters, except it says 'conlang club' in bold in the middle." width="300"></a>

    <figure>
      <a href="assets/images/propaganda/symmetry-toki.png"><img class="border" src="assets/images/propaganda/symmetry-toki.png" alt="A poster advertising the Conlang Club, written entirely in Toki Pona." width="300"></a>

      <a href="assets/images/propaganda/symmetry-en.png"><img class="border" src="assets/images/propaganda/symmetry-en.png" alt="The same poster written in English." width="300"></a>

      <figcaption>A version of the poster written in a conlang would always be put side-by-side with an English version of the poster. The overall design of each would be the same except for the background color, so the viewer understands they are the same poster in different languages.</figcaption>

    <figure>
      <a href="assets/images/propaganda/pun.png"><img class="border" src="assets/images/propaganda/pun.png" alt="A poster that compares phonetics exams with the tense-front-high-unrounded vowel [i], and the Conlang Club with the lax schwa [ə]." width="500"></a>

      <figcaption>In phonetics, [i] is considered a tense vowel, whereas the schwa [ə] is lax, hence the comparison.</figcaption>
