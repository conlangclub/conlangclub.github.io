    <h2>Trilangle</h2>
    <p class="lead">Trilangle is an engineered artlang written using tessellating triangles of different colors. The placement of triangles along a 2D plane determines the syntax of each sentence, with "verbs" that can mutually take each other as subjects and objects. You can parse sentences starting at any word in the sentence and still get the same meaning. It does not have a native lexicon.</p>
    <p>Trilangle started as a Conlang Club project during Summer 2021 to experiment with conlangs utilizing shape and color. It has been developed by Frederick ever since.</p>
