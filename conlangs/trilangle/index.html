    <p class="lead">Trilangle is an engineered artlang written using colorful tessellating triangles. The placement of triangles along a 2D plane determines the syntax of each sentence, with "verbs" that can mutually take each other as subjects and objects. Sentences can be parsed starting at any word in the sentence and still get the same meaning.</p>
    <p>Trilangle started as a Conlang Club project during Summer 2021 to experiment with conlangs utilizing shape and color. It has been developed by Frederick ever since, with a particular focus on the formal semantics of the language.</p>
    <p>Trilangle doesn't have its own lexicon, so it borrows one from English. The lexicon can be exchanged for another language's, including Toki Pona.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Use shape and color meaningfully</h3>
      <p>The first version of Trilangle was created while trying to utilize color and shape in a conlang, so further versions of Trilangle should continue this spirit. The default written form of Trilangle should be colorful, with color and shape representing meaning. Since the name of the language is <i>Trilangle,</i> shapes should conform to a triangular grid.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Writable with a 4-color pen, readable in monochrome</h3>
      <p>The default, in-color writing system of Trilangle should be writable using a common Bic 4-color pen, specifically by only using red, green, blue, and black. For convenience, it should also be unambiguous in monochrome only, so it can be written with just a regular pen.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Maximize parsimony</h3>
      <p>Trilangle should be able to talk about complex things using a combination of simple rules. Exceptions for edge cases should be minimized so that the grammar is easy to remember. It really sucks when there's too many rules, and it's impossible to use or work on the language because you can't remember them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Have a formal semantics interpretation</h3>
      <p>Semantics is cool and often overlooked in conlanging, and making a formal semantics representation of Trilangle is an interesting challenge. This is especially difficult if we want to be able to say all anything a natural language can, since Trilangle needs to balance logical consistency, expressiveness, and parsimony all while contrained to a 2D triangle grid.</p>

      <p class="lead">Triangles assert existence, which are qualified by predicates. Red triangles ("Reds" for short) assert the existence of objects and entities.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>The red triangle above asserts the existence of an object-type variable x, and that x is a cat. You can think of the variable x as being like a subject in a sentence or clause, and the predicate in the triangle is, of course, the predicate. That means a single triangle can be an entire sentence on its own!</p>

      <p>Note that the choice of variable is arbitrary, and two different triangles will assert the existence of two different variables.</p>

      <p>Notice how the Red, when attached to the bottom of the Blue, donates its own variable x to the Blue. The Blue now uses x as an argument to sleep and becomes ∃e sleep(e, x) <i>("x is sleeping")</i> instead of just ∃e sleep(e) <i>("sleep is happening.")</i></p>

      <p>In the example below, four Reds are all trying to donate their variable in all directions, but none of them accept donations, so they don't use each others' variables in their predicates.</p>
