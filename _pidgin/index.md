### What is it?
The Pidgin Game is an ongoing, collaborative language experiment. Periodically, players get together in a voice call and Minecraft server to play Minecraft. The catch is that no one is allowed to speak the same language at the start. The goal of this is to create a new, shared pidgin language that we can all understand.

### Scheduling
PidginCraft happens every Tuesday at 6 PM Pacific time, starting October 22, 2024. Participation in the voice channel of our Discord server is required, and we can give you the IP address there.

### How to join?
New players can join at any time. The only prerequisite for joining is that you own Minecraft. After that you can attend our weekly Minecraft sessions in the SCC Discord and try to make yourself understood in a common pidgin language.
