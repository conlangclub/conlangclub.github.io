### What's this?
The Pidgin Game is an ongoing, collaborative language experiment. Periodically, players get together in a voice call and Minecraft server to play Minecraft. The catch is that no one is allowed to speak the same language at the start. The goal of this is to create a new, shared pidgin language that we can all understand.

### Scheduling
PidginCraft happens **every Tuesday at 6 PM** Pacific time, starting October 22, 2024. Participation in the voice channel of our Discord server is required, and we can give you the IP address there.

### How to join
New players can join at any time. The only prerequisite for joining is that you own Minecraft. After that you can attend our weekly Minecraft sessions in the [SCC Discord](/discord) and try to make yourself understood in a common pidgin language.

### Rules
1. You may not use any pre-existing language (e.g. English, Esperanto) when communicating ideas in our Minecraft world or in the #pidgin-speaking channel
1. Any new words you create must be made up, either on the fly or ahead of time, but try to existing words in the pidgin if possible.
1. We will come together at the end of every session to document the state of the language.
1. You should converse with the pidgin outside of the synchronous sessions
1. (Optional) think of a language feature you want to introduce to the pidgin, but keep is secret. Try to make other people use your language feature.

### FAQ
#### How is it possible to communicate with anybody if we can't use natural languages or common conlangs?
You can invent new words and grammar rules as you need them. You can communicate the meaning of your words by doing actions (e.g., say your word for 'stone' while placing stone blocks).

#### I find it hard to invent words and grammar rules on the fly, how can I make it easier for myself?
One strategy is to come up with some words without meaning before a Minecraft session. Then when it comes time to play Minecraft, if you encounter a concept that you want to communicate, you can just pick from that list of words and assign it a meaning. You can also come up with grammar rules ahead of time if you want.

#### Do I have to attend every meeting?
No, there is no such expectation. Regularly attending meetings will help you practice your pidgin language skills, but you can also read the periodically released grammar write-ups/vocab lists to catch up.

#### Other players seem to be able to understand each other a bit, but I am completely lost. How can I catch up?
Read the periodically released grammar write-ups/vocab lists

#### I can't find what I am looking for in the grammar write-up/vocab list, what do I do?
Words and phrases only get added to the vocab list/grammar write-up after they've been used a few times. In that case, you can just invent a new word or grammar rule (or take one from your personal conlang).

#### I want to invent a new word for something, but I think someone else already made a word for it. What should I do?
If you can not find a word in the vocab list, it is perfectly acceptable to invent a new word for something, even if you think someone else has already made a word for it. Even if you can find a word in the vocab list, the pidgin language is fluid and evolving and the meaning of words may change overtime, so it may be necessary to re-invent a word for some idea.
