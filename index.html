          <dt class="font-bold">IPA Scrabble</dt>
          <dd>Scrabble played with letters from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) instead of the English alphabet. If you can convince everyone you pronounce a word a certain way, then the word is legal. Typically involves arguing about how each person pronounces words.</dd>
