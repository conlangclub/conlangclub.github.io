      <h2>About the Conlang Club</h2>
      <p>We are the Conlang Club at the University of Washington, founded in Fall 2019 by like-minded fans and creators of <b>con</b>structed <b>lang</b>uages, or conlangs. Since then, we have had regular meetings where we create, discuss, and critique conlangs of all types. While not everyone is a linguistics major, we are all passionate about language and we welcome you to join us and create your own― <strong>no experience necessary!</strong></p>

      <h3>Common meeting activities</h3>
      <p>Our meetings are mostly unstructured, but we have some activities we commonly do each meeting. Feel free to suggest activities for the next meeting, or volunteer to give a lightning talk!</p>
      <dl class="dl-aligned">
        <dt>Club conlangs</dt>
        <dd>We often work on conlangs altogether as a whole club, usually centered around a central theme or set of goals. Look at some of our <a href="#club-projects">previous club conlangs</a> and see the variety of conlangs we've made!</dd>

        <dt>Lightning talks</dt>
        <dd>Members present a short 10-minute lightning talk about their own conlangs, cool features of real languages, or anything else club-related.</dd>

        <dt>Conlang potluck</dt>
        <dd>We create a short sentence with each word glossed/annotated with its morphology and meaning. Then, we present them and try to create one language that would make all of those sentences grammatical.</dd>

        <dt>Lingustic puzzles</dt>
        <dd>We work on linguistics puzzles as a club, usually Linguistics Olympiad problems from previous years.</dd>

        <dt>IPA Scrabble</dt>
        <dd>Scrabble played with letters from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) instead of the English alphabet. If you can convince everyone you pronounce a word a certain way, then the word is legal. Typically involves arguing about how each person pronounces words.</dd>

      <p class="lead">The Conlang Club has worked together on a large variety of conlangs, some silly, others serious, but mostly in between.</p>

        <h3>I'tslmaw (i:t͡sɬma)</h3>
        <span class="text-muted">Fall 2019</span>
        <p>The club conlang that started it all. A bizarre conlang with grammatical seasonality, a borderline unpronounceable phonology, and where the only verbs are "consume" and "produce," but noun <em>cases</em> are an open class. In addition to normal cases like Nominative and Accusative, it also features unusual ones like the Pursuit case which combine with the two verbs to form special meanings.</p>

        <h3>Auxlang with CFG</h3>
        <span class="text-muted">Spring - Fall 2020</span>
        <p>An attempt at an auxlang where all sentences can be generated and parsed using a context-free grammar. Notably lacks any inflectional morphology, cases, gender, grammatical number, and "delimiter" words that separate subordinate clauses and sentence arguments.</p>

        <h3>Time: The Conlang</h3>
        <span class="text-muted">Spring 2020</span>
        <p>Time: The Conlang is spoken by people who are constantly transitioning between two different alternate timelines called <i>North Time</i> and <i>South Time</i>. Each timeline differs in various aspects (for example, North Time's food is gourmet while South Time's food is mostly vending-machine quality), with the world around you changing as you move forward in time.</p>

        <h3>The Forest</h3>
        <span class="text-muted">Fall 2020 - Winter 2021</span>
        <p>The Forest is a fantasy worldbuilding project centered around a forest with a giant, magical tree in the middle that is the basis for all life. We started with a proto-language spoken by sentient tree-like progenitors, and used it as the basis for a variety of daugher languages to create the Forest's language family. Each language is spoken by one of various fantasy peoples, like the Mercantiles, the Fungus people, the Vine people, and the Faeries.</p>

        <h3>Trilangle</h3>
        <span class="text-muted">Summer 2021</span>
        <p>An engineered artlang written using tessellating triangles of different colors. The placement of triangles along a 2D plane determines the syntax of each sentence, with "verbs" that can mutually take each other as subjects and objects. You can parse sentences starting at any word in the sentence and still get the same meaning. After working on it as a club conlang, Frederick is actively working on Trilangle on his own to further develop the syntax and semantics, including formal-language representations.</p>
