    <p class="lead">
      The selected fingers of a handshape are considered the active fingers of the hand that:
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside ps-5">
        <li>Can assume a specific configuration (e.g. extended, bent, hooked)</li>
        <li>Can have internal movement (e.g. wiggling)</li>
        <li>Are the fingers that contact other locations or hands</li>
      </ul>

    <h4 class="text-2xl">Marked and unmarked handshapes</h4>

    <p class="lead">
      Marked handshapes are handshapes that tend to have certain phonotactic constraints:
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside ps-5">
        <li>Marked handshapes usually do not undergo internal movement</li>
        <li>Marked handshapes usually do not appear in classifiers</li>
        <li>Marked handshapes are more restricted in how they contact a location</li>
        <li>In <a href="{{ 'sign-types.html' | relative_link }}">Type 3</a> signs, marked handshapes are usually disallowed in the nondominant hand</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>What handshapes are considered marked in a language differs depending on the language. However, linguists do not agree on a single set of criteria for what should be considered a marked or unmarked handshape.</p>
